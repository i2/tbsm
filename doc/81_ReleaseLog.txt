          Thanks to Ian for this very welcome patch


2017-10-28  v0.4
=======================================
682e371 - Only start X session from tty
          This patch is pretty untested and breaks hopefully no use case
cfc4134 - New command exit/X to logout from tty
0422ab7 - Fix broken .desktop checking / parameter building
          Some session didn't start because of this and the too much parameter
d7ddd83 - Don't start a session when not running in tty
          Treat all in /usr/share/xsessions as such and with Type=XSession
e9b76ec - Don't 'exec' terminal programs, just start them
          Bad idea?
daf86d9 - Add display name to XserverArg
          Done by simply use the tty number as X display name
c16c915 - Review verbosity
          You may notice some more chattering but verboseLevel=2/info should be
          ok for daily work, neverless level 3/verbose is default now to become
          familar

2016-01-19  v0.1  [YANKED]
=======================================

          Hello World!

Aside from all bling-bling there are some things to note about removed code from
CDMs original which may make tbsm not yet a replacement of CDM for you:

- There is no search for next empty VT
- There is no check if X is already running somewhere
- There is no SPAWN set or checked
- And maybe something else removed which I forgot to mention

so you are warned.
But it is getting worse: This very first version is not very well tested!

Anyway have fun,
Lothar
